      It's important to adapt a strategic approach for the best cyber security.
      Make everyone on the team involved and keep them educated on the topic.
      Adapt a cybersecurity framework to ensure you have guidelines on how to
      manage security and make sure the entire team knows about this. Always
      automate and integrate security tools and use diverse security measures.
      It is good practice to use a vulnerability scanner, but make sure to
      combine it with other tools. There is less room for error with automated
      processes and issues will be found early, making it much easier to
      eliminate them. Do penetration tests and network scans frequently. One of
      the best things to do is performing mock attacks to test how secure your
      web application is. Keeping track of popular threats is key. It is highly
      recommended to use HTTPS protocols to prevent vulnerabilities. Keep the
      users safe by utilizing the most effective forms of password management,
      like two factor authentication, and only store and display data you
      absolutely need. Never trust data from the browser and always assume the
      worst!
